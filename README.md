# BrainBeats
BrainBeats is the product name of our project. In this device, we use the TGAM chip to acquire raw EEG data. 
We perform preliminary binary classification of fatigue and alertness through machine learning. 
The frontend interacts with the user and displays the raw data and classification results.
